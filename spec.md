- Build Consultation Services section with 4 gold-bordered cards (Birth Chart Reading, Career & Finance Consultation, Marriage & Relationship Guidance, Dasha & Predictive Analysis), each with a "Book Now" button linking to the Google Form in a new tab
- Build Courses section with 4 premium course cards showing title, strikethrough MRP, saffron-highlighted discounted price, short description, and "Enroll Now" button linking to each course's specific Google Form in a new tab (no internal checkout)
